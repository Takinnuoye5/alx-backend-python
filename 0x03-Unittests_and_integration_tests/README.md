# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## UnitTests

### Back-end

This project focuses on writing unit tests and integration tests for the Alx Africa project using the Holberton School curriculum. The main goal is to ensure that the functions and code paths work as expected under different scenarios and inputs.

#### What are Unit Tests?

Unit testing is a crucial process in software development where individual units or components of code are tested to verify that they function as expected. In the case of this project, unit tests will be applied to specific functions to ensure they return the expected results for various inputs, including standard inputs and corner cases.

The key characteristics of unit tests are as follows:
- They focus on testing the logic defined inside the function being tested.
- Calls to additional functions, especially those that make network or database calls, should be mocked to isolate the specific functionality being tested.
- The primary question a unit test aims to answer is: "If everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected?"

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests, on the other hand, aim to test a code path end-to-end. Unlike unit tests that focus on isolated units of code, integration tests will test interactions between every part of the codebase. However, in general, only low-level functions that make external calls, such as HTTP requests, file I/O, and database I/O, are mocked during integration testing.

#### Running Tests

To execute the tests for this project, run the following command:

```
$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
```

## Resources

Before starting the project, you can read or watch the following resources to familiarize yourself with the necessary concepts and tools:

- [unittest documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - The official Python documentation for the unittest framework.
- [unittest.mock documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) - The official Python documentation for the mock object library, which is useful for creating mocks and stubs during testing.
- [How to mock a readonly property with mock?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11836436/how-to-mock-a-readonly-property-with-mock) - Stack Overflow thread discussing how to mock a readonly property with mock.
- [parameterized documentation](https://pypi.org/project/parameterized/) - A library for parameterized testing in Python.
- [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) - Learn about memoization, a common optimization technique in testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without using external references:

- The difference between unit and integration tests.
- Common testing patterns, such as mocking, parametrizations, and fixtures.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).
- All your files must be executable.
- All your modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- A documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Required Files

Ensure the following files are available for this project:

- `utils.py` (or download)
- `client.py` (or download)
- `fixtures.py` (or download)

**Note:** This README.md file should be present at the root of the project folder and is mandatory.
