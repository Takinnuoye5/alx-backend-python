# Async Comprehension - README

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the **Async Comprehension** project. The project focuses on asynchronous generators, async comprehensions, and type-annotated generators in Python.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain how to write an asynchronous generator
- Demonstrate the usage of async comprehensions
- Understand how to type-annotate generators

## Resources
Before starting the project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0530/)
- [What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#asynchronous-generators-and-comprehensions)
- [Type-hints for generators](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#type-annotations-for-generators)

## Requirements
To complete this project, the following requirements must be met:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Your code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
- The length of your files will be tested using the `wc` command
- All modules should have documentation (run `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to check)
- All functions should have documentation (run `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` to check)
- Documentation should be descriptive and provide a clear explanation of the purpose of the module, class, or method
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
