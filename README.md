# ALX Backend Python

This project focuses on developing backend applications using Python. It covers various aspects of building robust and efficient server-side applications. 

## Concepts

This project covers the following concepts:

- Web development using Python
- API development
- Database integration
- Authentication and authorization
- Data validation and error handling
- Testing and debugging

## Resources

Before starting this project, it is recommended to have a good understanding of the following:

- Python programming language
- Web frameworks like Flask or Django
- Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- RESTful API principles
- Version control with Git
- Testing frameworks (e.g., pytest)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Develop web applications using Python and a web framework of your choice.
- Create and manage APIs to handle various client requests.
- Integrate a database into your application and perform CRUD operations.
- Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Handle data validation and error handling to ensure robustness.
- Write comprehensive tests for your code to ensure reliability and identify bugs.
- Understand best practices in backend development.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or higher
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should follow the PEP 8 style guide
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Project Structure

Your project should have the following structure:

```
alx-backend-python/
├── app.py
├── database.py
├── models.py
├── routes.py
├── tests/
│   ├── test_routes.py
│   └── test_models.py
└── README.md
```

- `app.py`: The main application file where you initialize your web framework and define routes.
- `database.py`: Contains functions or classes to interact with the database.
- `models.py`: Defines the database models or schemas.
- `routes.py`: Contains the route handlers for different endpoints of your API.
- `tests/`: Directory to store your test files.
- `tests/test_routes.py`: Test cases for your route handlers.
- `tests/test_models.py`: Test cases for your database models.
- `README.md`: Documentation file explaining the project and its components.

Feel free to add more files or directories as needed for your specific project.
