# Python Async Project

This project focuses on learning and implementing asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. The goal is to gain a solid understanding of the `async` and `await` syntax, executing async programs with `asyncio`, running concurrent coroutines, creating asyncio tasks, and utilizing the `random` module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external references:

- The `async` and `await` syntax in Python
- How to execute an async program using `asyncio`
- Running concurrent coroutines to improve performance
- Creating asyncio tasks for managing concurrent operations
- Utilizing the `random` module for generating random values

## Resources

Before starting the project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)
- [asyncio - Asynchronous I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- [random.uniform - Python Standard Library Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform)

## Requirements

Please ensure that you meet the following requirements while working on this project:

### General

- Create a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Use one of the allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- The files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7).
- All files should end with a new line.
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using the `wc` command.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Adhere to the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5.x) for your code.
- Type-annotate all functions and coroutines.
- Each module should have proper documentation accessible via `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
- Each function should have documentation available via `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`.
- Ensure that the documentation for modules, classes, and methods is informative and consists of complete sentences.

Remember to create a meaningful project structure, write clear and concise code, and provide documentation that explains the purpose and functionality of the project components.

Good luck with your Python async project!
