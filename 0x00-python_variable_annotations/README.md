# 0x00-python_variable_annotations

This project focuses on advanced Python concepts and specifically covers type annotations in Python 3. It explores how type annotations can be used to specify function signatures and variable types, as well as the concept of duck typing. Additionally, it demonstrates how to validate your code using `mypy`.

## Concepts

This project covers the following concept:

- Advanced Python

## Resources

Before starting this project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Type annotations in Python 3
- How to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Understanding duck typing
- How to validate your code with `mypy`

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (execute `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (execute `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (execute `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Documentation should be meaningful sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length will be verified)
